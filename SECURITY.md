## Reporting a Vulnerability

If a vulnerability is discovered, please open an issue and provide a 'vulnerability' label to the issue. We always aim to respond within a 24 hour window. 

In order to help expediate the resolution time of a vulnerability, it is recommended to include as much information as possible including operating system, 
stack traces, or any other applicable information that will help us in recreating the vulnerability. 

Once we are able to successfully recreatea a found vulnerability we can then provide an estimated time for resolution.
